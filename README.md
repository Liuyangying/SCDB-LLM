## Overview

This project involves the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to encode variables based on text extracted from Supreme Court cases. The LLM is trained to understand and process the language used in legal documents, specifically focusing on decisions and opinions from the United States Supreme Court. The encoded variables can be used for various legal research and analysis purposes.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: The LLM is capable of extracting and processing text from Supreme Court cases, including decisions, opinions, and related documents.

- **Variable Encoding**: The extracted text is processed by the LLM to encode relevant variables, which can include legal principles, key arguments, case details, and more.

- **Customizable Encoding**: The encoding process can be customized based on specific research requirements and the types of variables you're interested in extracting.

- **Data Export**: Encoded variables can be exported in a structured format for further analysis, data visualization, and integration with other tools.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start using the Supreme Court Case Variable Encoding LLM:

1. **Installation**: [Instructions on how to install and set up the LLM for your project.]

2. **Data Collection**: [Information on how to gather Supreme Court case text data for input.]

3. **Encoding Process**: [Details on how to use the LLM to encode variables from the collected text data.]

4. **Exporting Data**: [Instructions on how to export encoded variables for analysis.]

## Example Usage

```python
# Sample Python code demonstrating how to use the LLM for variable encoding
import supreme_llm

# Initialize the LLM model
model = supreme_llm.SupremeLLM()

# Load and preprocess Supreme Court case text
case_text = supreme_llm.load_case_text('path_to_case.txt')

# Encode variables from the case text
encoded_variables = model.encode_variables(case_text)

# Print the encoded variables
print(encoded_variables)
